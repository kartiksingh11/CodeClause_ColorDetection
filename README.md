# CodeClause_ColorDetection

## Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. This project can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

# What does this program do?

# Feature Extraction: Perform feature extraction for getting the R, G, B Color Histogram values of training images
# Training K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier: Train KNN classifier by R, G, B Color Histogram values
# Classifying by Trained KNN: Read Web Cam frame by frame, perform feature extraction on each frame and then classify the mean color of it by trained KNN classifier.
